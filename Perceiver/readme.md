## Coding Challenge (Due Date: October 7, 2021 at 12 PM PST)

Use DeepMind's Perceiver IO model to classify any type of Medical Image (CT scans, Brain Scans, etc.). You can use the alphacare notebook in the computer vision folder as a starting point, labeled "perceiver". Submit your code to this link and post a classified image example on your favorite social network with the hashtag #AlphaCare. I'll announce the winner in 2 weeks, and we'll integrate their code into this repository. AlphaCare will become more and more multi-purpose as we continually add capabilities to it.
